## Why
- based on experience
  - always done in hind sight
  - require refactoring on long run
  - clean up low in Biz value
  - always typeing same boiler code (IoC, argument parser, app level exception handlings.. etc)
- Want to use IoC with more features
  - But like the convienence of MS DI extensions provided by other libraries
