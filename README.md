# C# toolbox

This repository contains the collection of ideas and helpful utilities I find useful or keep referring to over the years.

Putting them in one place allows me to reuse and refer quickly when i want to.

This also serves as a example sandbox for some ideas I wish to keep but have no time or need to fully implement them yet.

Many of the code here are based on others, or stolen all over.

If I miss some credit to your work or if you wish for it to be removed, please contact me and i will do so.
